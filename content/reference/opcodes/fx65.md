# Fx65 - Load registers from memory

## Assembly Syntax
**Octo:** `load v<x>`\
**Chipper:** `LD V<x>,[I]`

{{< inline-svg "img/svg/op-fx65.svg" >}}

## Available
[CHIP-8](/reference/variants/classic-chip-8), [CHIP-48](/reference/variants/chip-48), [SUPER-CHIP](/reference/variants/superchip), [MEGA-CHIP](/reference/variants/megachip8), [XO-CHIP](/reference/variants/xo-chip)

## Description

Loads the values of registers `V0` through `Vx` from memory, starting at the address stored in `I`.
This operation increments `I` by `x + 1`.

## Quirks

**Memory**
: The traditional, and the modern way is to increment `I` by `x + 1`. This quirk will let `I` unchanged.

**MemoryX**
: There is a less uncommon variant of the memory quirk, that increments `I` by just `x`. It is the
Behavior of CHIP-48 and SUPER-CHIP v1.0. Not many programs rely on this quirk.

## Variant Specific Notes:

The quirk mapping is as follows:

| Variant         | Memory             | MemoryX            |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| CHIP-8          | -                  | -                  |
| CHIP-48         | -                  | :white_check_mark: |
| SUPER-CHIP v1.0 | -                  | :white_check_mark: |
| SUPER-CHIP v1.1 | :white_check_mark: | -                  |
| MEGA-CHIP       | :white_check_mark: | -                  |
| XO-CHIP         | -                  | -                  |
