# Fx75 - Store registers to flag storage

## Assembly Syntax
**Octo:** `saveflags v<x>`\
**Chipper:** `LD R,V<x>`

{{< inline-svg "img/svg/op-fx75.svg" >}}

## Available
[CHIP-8](/reference/variants/classic-chip-8), [CHIP-48](/reference/variants/chip-48), [SUPER-CHIP](/reference/variants/superchip), [MEGA-CHIP](/reference/variants/megachip8), [XO-CHIP](/reference/variants/xo-chip)

## Description

Stores the values of registers `V0` through `Vx` (`x <= 7`) in memory, starting at the address stored in `I`.

It is directly related to 64 bits persistent flag storage on a HP-48SX calculator,
that programs could write to or read from. These 64 bits on the calculator are global
(so all programs see the same) and you can only fit 8 bytes in it, thus the limit to
registers V0-V7.

> [!NOTE]
> **NOTE:** \
> Generic emulators are rather free to choose what "persistent flag storage" means.
> Typical options are:
> - static array that keeps the state independend of the emulation been reset or different programs loaded
> - shared file, that is fetched later on restart
> - per-ROM file that allows different programs to store their own state
>
> If you choose a file, think about some kind of caching to not read from or write 
> to the file on every opcode execution, as this would slow down the emulation but
> could also be executed in a tight loop. Use some cache and flush it on exit
> and optionally a periodic update on change at a limited rate.

## Variant Specific Notes:

### XO-CHIP

Not limited by the constraints of the calculator SUPER-CHIP was written for, XO-CHIP allows all registers to be stored and loaded, so `x <= 15`.
