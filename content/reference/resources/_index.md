CHIP-8 or its variants:

* [⎋ Chip-8 on the COSMAC VIP](https://www.laurencescotford.net/2020/07/25/chip-8-on-the-cosmac-vip-index/), by Laurence Scotford\
  A deep dive into the CHIP-8 interpreter on the COSMAC VIP with disassembly and lots of comments, a recommended read for anyone trying to mimic or understand the original CHIP-8 better.

### Finding CHIP-8 Variant Games

* [⎋ CHIP-8 Archive](https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/) by John Earnest, a good selection of programs with preview, many from OctoJams
* [⎋ Chip-8 Database](https://archive.org/details/chip-8-games) by Sylvain (Sly DC) De Chantal, probably the most complete CHIP-8 collection, but can be a bit overwhelming due to the many variants, also some programs are wrongly categorized.
