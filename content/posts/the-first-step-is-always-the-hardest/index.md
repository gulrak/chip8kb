For a few years I’ve started and stopped working on CHIP-8 documentation. I don’t enjoy writing docs
the same way I enjoy writing code. But over the last years I’ve learned something: many of the most
commonly used CHIP-8 resources are, in my opinion, incomplete, ambiguous, or occasionally misleading.

This leads to many new CHIP-8
implementations sharing the same errors and to frustration on their developers. During our everyday support
work in #chip-8 of the EmuDev Discord, we come across a lot of these cases.

<!--more-->

So this is my attempt to document CHIP-8 with as many of its [variants](/reference/variants/) as possible. Pointing out the details, the
pitfalls, and the tricky parts. Hopefully this will help others to avoid the same mistakes or give them a resource
to fix or improve their implementations.

Is this the best documentation out there, or just another case of [xkcd #927](https://xkcd.com/927/)? Probably the
latter. This take is certainly not perfect, writing good documentation is hard, and English is not even my native language.
But I decided to still add my take on this to the pool of knowledge, and I hope some find it useful.

Parts of the documentation are still missing, and others are resurrected fragments of my previous attempts.
It sure will take a while to get the structure settled and the content polished.

Bear with me on this journey.
