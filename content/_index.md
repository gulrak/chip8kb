- ## Yet Another CHIP-8 Tutorial
  I, too, have written a CHIP-8 tutorial, to try and help others get started. I hope to expand on it, based
  on feedback and suggestions. It is tightly coupled with the CHIP-8 test suite by Timendus. The tutorial
  tries to be programming language agnostic, but will be coupled with some example code for a selection of
  languages if one is totally stuck or out of ideas.

  (The tutorial is still a work in progress, and not yet published.)


- ## CHIP-8 Resources
  My collection of knowledge and resources about CHIP-8 and its variants. Over the last years I have
  implemented over twenty variants of CHIP-8 and collected a few insights into the inner workings of
  most variants out there. The reference is my attempt to document them all. It sure will take time
  to complete, but I hope it helps you in your endeavor.
